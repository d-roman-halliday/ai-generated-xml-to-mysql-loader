## MySQL Database

```
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS xml_loader_example;

-- Create the user (if it doesn't already exist)
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'xml_loader_example_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_strong_password'; -- Replace with a real password!

-- Grant all privileges on the database to the user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON xml_loader_example.* TO 'xml_loader_example_user'@'%';
